# OVERVIEW

This mod gives users a way to change the color of any RGB device based on the current style rank or upon game events such as killing enemies, losing hp, etc.

# WARNING

Mod is updated for ULTRA_REVAMP. As of writing, you *must* have HideManagerGameObject set to true in BepInEx.cfg.

This mod requires an external piece of software that you must download.

This uses OpenRGB. Due to the way it works, it could possibly damage your devices (supposedly). You can view more about this on their website.

Currently OpenRGB 0.9 is the only version supported.

If you encounter an issue, raise an issue on the github or ontact me at discord: daemon8363, preferrably in #ultrakill-modding if you encounter problems.

# REQUIREMENTS

The Ultrakill plugin (you must have it downloaded and enabled) 

OpenRGB (use v0.9): https://openrgb.org/		Releases: https://openrgb.org/releases.html

# HOW TO USE

1. Start OpenRGB and make sure that it can access whatever RGB devices you need (if it doesn't work the first time, run it in admin mode).
 
2. In OpenRGB, switch to the "SDK Server" tab and click the "Start Server" button. The host should be 0.0.0.0, and the port 6742 (these are the default options). 

3. In the plugin configurator menu for the plugin, set up your options. Then click the "Connect" button.
